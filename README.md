# Unreal Engine & AirSim Drone Simulation with LLaMA Speech Recognition Integration #
## Overview ##
This project integrates __Unreal Engine__ and the __AirSim__ drone simulation platform with __LLaMA-based language models__ and __speech recognition__ functionality. 
The goal is to allow users to control a drone through voice commands, processed by the LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct model.

## Features ##
__Drone Simulation__: Controlled via Unreal Engine with AirSim.
__Speech Recognition__: Converts voice commands to text and uses LLM model to processess texy commands.

## Prerequisites ##
Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

Unreal Engine (v4.27 or later)
  Microsoft AirSim
  Python 3.8 or later
  PyAudio
  LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct Model
  Whisper Model for Speech Recognition
  Python Libraries: wave, pyttsx3, pyaudio, faster-whisper
